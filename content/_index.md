Hi, Iâ€™m Felix!

I am a rising third year PhD student with the Tye Lab at the Salk Institute and the Benna Lab at UCSD where I study how populations of neurons encode information within ethological contexts. Specifically, I am interested in how changes within an animal's internal state lead to changes within its neural representations and how these representations evolve over time. For instance, how chronic mild stress can induce depression.

In my free time, I like baking, swimming and trying new foods!

Please feel free to get in touch!
