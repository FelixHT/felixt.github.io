Hi, Iâ€™m Felix!

I am a second year PhD student with the Tye Lab at the Salk Institute and the Benna Lab at UCSD where I study how populations of neurons represent social information, and how such representations are learned.

In my free time, I like baking, swimming and trying new foods!

Please feel free to get in touch!
